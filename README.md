## Introduction

Welcome to 2D carbon structure database!

Carbon, the king of elements, not only forms the chemical basis of all known life on the Earth, but also plays a leading role in science and technology. The novel properties of graphene highly motivate scientists to explore other 2D carbon structures such as penta-graphene, phagraphene,T-graphene, octagraphene, supergraphene, twin graphene, and popgraphene. In this 2D carbon database, we compiled the reported 2D carbon structures for the research convenience. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
