# 2D-Carbon-Database

Database for 2D Carbon sheets, developed by the research group led by Professor Qian Wang from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Peking University.

Welcome to 2D carbon structure database!

Carbon, the king of elements, not only forms the chemical basis of all known life on the Earth, but also plays a leading role in science and technology. The novel properties of graphene highly motivate scientists to explore other 2D carbon structures such as penta-graphene, phagraphene,T-graphene, octagraphene, supergraphene, twin graphene, and popgraphene. In this 2D carbon database, we compiled the reported 2D carbon structures for the research convenience. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
